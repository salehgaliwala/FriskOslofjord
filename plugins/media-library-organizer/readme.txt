No limits! Create as many folders, subfolders, and organize as many media files as you need.

### What file types are supported? ###
Media Library Organizer works with all WordPress-supported file types, including images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP), videos (MP4, MOV, AVI), audio files (MP3, WAV), documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX), and any other media format that WordPress allows you to upload.
